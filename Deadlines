Please respect the following deadlines:

### Conference Abstracts

Please send me a draft at least two weeks before the deadline. 
All external conference abstracts must be circulated to all co-authors (including consortia) at least one week before the final deadline.

### Posters

Please send me your poster to review at least one week before you need to send to print.
Please note, you may need to send to print a week or more ahead of the conference. Be prepared for this!

### Presentations

Please review/send me slides for internal WIP and seminars at least one week before presenting.
For external presentations (ie, at international conferences), please also schedule a slot at psychgen lab meeting to rehearse your talk.

### Reports and written work

Please allow me a full week to read and give feedback on written work. 
For important reports (thesis outlines, first year reports, etc), I would like to see two drafts. 
This likely means you need to send me the first draft MORE then two weeks before the final deadline.

Do not assume that I will provide feedback over a weekend or holiday, unless I have explicitly said that this is ok.
