We have a few standing (ie, recurring) meetings to take note of:

1.  Lab meeting. 
    We will meet for one hour as a group, weekly. Topics of the meetings will alternate between phenotype & statistics; eg, week 1 might be biobank-derived phenotypes; week 2 eQTL architecture. 
    The agenda for each meeting will be set one week in advance. Each week, one of two lab members will give a brief update on their work (~10 minutes). (More details to follow).

    During April/May 2020, lab meetings are at 1pm EST, over zoom (usual zoom link). 

2.  Psychgen Lab Meeting. 
    We meet as a division once a week. This time is currently being updated. 
    
    During April/May 2020, these are postponed
    
3.  Office Hours.
    If you have any questions or concerns about your work, or anything else, my office hours are Friday 10:30-12:00. 
    
    During April/May 2020, these are postponed: instead, we have slack office hours at any time.  
    
4. One to one meetings. You should each have a scheduled one-to-one meeting with me every week. Please send me an agenda for this meeting by 5pm the day before. 
    
5. For April/May 2020, we have regular zoom-coffee hours at 3pm. Mondays are for the whole PsychGen division; every other day is just Huckins Lab. Bring pets, crafts, cups of coffee. No talk of coronavirus or science is allowed.
