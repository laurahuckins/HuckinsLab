We have a few standing (ie, recurring) meetings to take note of:

1.  Lab meeting. 
    We will meet for one hour as a group, weekly. Topics of the meetings will alternate between phenotype & statistics; eg, week 1 might be biobank-derived phenotypes; week 2 eQTL architecture. 
    The agenda for each meeting will be set one week in advance. Each week, one of two lab members will give a brief update on their work (~10 minutes). (More details to follow).

2.  Psychgen Lab Meeting. 
    We meet as a division once a week. This time is currently being updated. 
    
3.  Office Hours.
    If you have any questions or concerns about your work, or anything else, my office hours are Friday 10:30-12:00.
