# HuckinsLab

These documents are designed as an introduction to HuckinsLab mission, goals, culture, and expectations.

I believe that setting explicit expectations and guidelines about lab culture is the best way to ensure a happy lab.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me!
