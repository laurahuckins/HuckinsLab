This file describes our travel policies to work events and conferences. This DOES NOT apply to vacation or personal travel.

1. Eligibility.
In order to attend a conference you need to submit an abstract. That abstract must be polished, approved by co-authors, and describe work that will be polished by the time of the conference (ie, ready for biorxiv by the conference, or soon thereafter). We do not submit preliminary work to major conferences.
The exception to this is first-year PhD students: you may attend one of ASHG/WCPG in the first year of your time in the lab, without submitting an abstract.

2. Which conferences?
The major conferences for our field are WCPG, ASHG, ACNP, SOBP, IGES. For eating disorder researchers, you may also consider ICED or EDRS.
If there is a relevant conference you would like to attend, let me know and we can discuss.

I have allocated funding for one conference/lab member (with an abstract) per year.
Exceptions to this rule:
Work of exceptional merit (ie, being considered for a young investigator award at a conference)
Lab members obtaining external funding (eg, conference travel awards, sinai travel awards, own grants)
Local conferences (NYC), which do not require flight or hotel costs.

3. Sinai-wide rules

In order to travel, you MUST submit a travel request in sinai central. Refer to the most recent sinai travel policy for how to do this.
You must submit your request with as much notice as possible- ideally, at least one month prior to travel, in order to have time for the request to be approved.
Students and postdocs may request a travel advance for the trip, to cover registration, hotel, travel, and per diems. I HIGHLY recommend that you do this- reimbursements are not immediate, and may take some time especially in conference season (Oct-Dec).

Please refer to the sinai policies for per diems.

You must book air travel through Sinai, and it must comply with the 'fly america' act, unless exceptional circumstances apply (eg, no flight for your destination complies with the act).
