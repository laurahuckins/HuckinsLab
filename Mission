Lab Mission: 

Our over-arching goal is to develop and apply complex statistical algorithms to probe the genetic, epigenetic, and higher-level multi-omic basis of understudied psychiatric disorders and trajectories. 
we will focus on historically under-studied and vulnerable populations, with an emphasis anorexia nervosa (AN) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following interpersonal violence and sexual assault.

The purpose of our research is ultimately to help understand psychiatric disorders. We hope that our results will lead to a deeper understanding of neurobiology; better treatments and medications; more effective, appropriate and timely interventions; and a relief of the shame, blame, guilt and fear surrounding poorly understood diagnoses.   

We will achieve these goals by asking thoughtful, nuanced questions. We will answer these questions by designing and applying statistical algorithms. These algorithms will encoporate multi-layered data, tying together variation in the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, and population phenome.
