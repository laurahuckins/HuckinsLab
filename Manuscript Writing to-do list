Congratulations, you're ready to write a manuscript! Here are some formatting steps to take to make the process smooth & straightforward.
This applies only to scientific manuscripts (ie, not Theses, Reviews, etc). 

Organisation:

All of our manuscripts (ie, where any of the lab are first author) are written in word. 
Use double-spacing
Use continuous line numbering throughout
Use 'page breaks' to create new sections for each of:
  TITLE PAGE
  ABSTRACT
  INTRODUCTION
  METHODS
  RESULTS
  DISCUSSION
  REFERENCES
  DATA ACCESS
  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  

All of our files are stored and shared in dropbox. Please create & share a dropbox folder named: "1stAuthor_SURNAME_TITLE" (if title is too long, a few descriptive words are fine. Eg: Johnson_AN_GREX)
DO NOT omit your surname! 
The dropbox folder should have the following sub-folders:
    AUTHOR GUIDELINES (save the target journal guidelines here)
    AUTHOR SPREADSHEET
    00_FORUPLOAD
    00_RESUBMISSION
    COMMENTS FROM COAUTHORS
    COVER LETTER
    MAIN MANUSCRIPT
    MAIN FIGURES
    MAIN TABLES
    SUPL FIGURES
    SUPL TABLES
    SUPL INFO
    USEFUL FILES
    
    
References:
You MUST use a reference manager. 
I will NOT read or edit manuscripts that include manually entered references: the risk of deleting references, or losing refernce order, is too high. 
I highly recommend Zotero- if you use any other reference manager you must include the bibtex file for the library in the 'useful files' dropbox subfolder.
