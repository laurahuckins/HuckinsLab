How to be a good unix/minerva/chimera user!

1. All folders should follow DATA or PROJECT driven organisation, NOT user driven!

EG: your folders should be named accoridng to the type of data or analyses they include. They should sit within the appropriate superfolder.
So if your PhD is in Anorexia genetics, and you study gwas, twas, and also method development: 
this is the WRONG way to handle it

Laura_PhD/

Slightly better (but still wrong):
Laura_PhD/Anorexia/GWAS
Laura_PhD/Anorexia/TWAS
Laura_PhD/Anorexia/PRS
Laura_PhD/Anorexia/scripts

Best of all:

data/Anorexia.plink
processed_data/GREX/Anorexia

results/GWAS/Anorexia
results/TWAS/Anorexia

methods/METHOD_NAME

scripts/Anorexia_GWAS
scripts/Anorexia_TWAS

Each folder you use should include a README file stating who made the files, and in the case of results files, also keep track of input/parameters/output files
Analyses should include log files where possible.

2. File naming. Keep your file names consistent and easy to understand. Try to include information, while still allowing your files to be used in for-loops and other automated processes if necessary (etc).

To do this:

i. Give each file a 'stem' name. Make this specific and clear. EG: PGCED
ii. Assign each qc step or analysis step a standardised stem name. Keep these the same between all your analyses if possible. EG: MAF, HWE, LDSC. If you want to add specific details, or more description, separate information with underscores. EG: MAF_gte5 (maf filetr for greater than or equal to 5%); HWE_1e06 (hardy-weinberg equilibirum filter at 1e-06)
iii. Name files including all qc/analysis steps performed, not just the latest step. Separate steps by periods. EG: PGCED; PGCED.MAF_gte5; PGCED.MAF_gte5.HWE_1e06
iv. Using the same stem descriptor for all files allows you to cycle through files easily for for-loops etc.

3. Keep files small.
Almost all files should be gzipped
syntax: gz $file
Zipped files can be read into R, python, awk, easily.
If you use a file less than once/month, consider tar as well:
tar -czf file file.tar.gz
