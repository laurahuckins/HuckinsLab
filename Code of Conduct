**Code of Conduct:** 
All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with this code of conduct.
This code will be enforced.
We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

These rules describe how you should behave, but also how you should expect to be treated. Anyone who breaks these rules should be reported to Dr. Huckins immediately.

I expect cooperation from all members of the lab, in order to ensure and protect a safe environment. These guidelines must be followed at all lab events. 

The Huckins Lab does not and will not tolerate harassment of anybody, in any form.
We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of race, gender, gender indentity and expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, body size, or religion (or lack thereof).

It is everyone's right to have their gender identity, chosen name, and desired pronouns respected in the workplace. All lab members will respect this. 
Following HRC guidelines, we will structure our lab documents and meetings to include a place to declare preferred names and pronouns. 

Sexual language and imagery are unacceptable at any lab venue or event, both on campus and offsite. These include, but are not limited to, lab meetings, presentations, symposia, discussions in the lab, etc. 
Instances where lab members travel to offsite meetings or conferences are considered 'lab events', and this code of conduct will apply. 
This code of conduct also applies to everyone you interact with at these conferences- whether from another lab, or another institution, it is unacceptable for anyone to make you uncomfortable in any way. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention
It is your right not to experience harassment in any form, and the Huckins lab will take any such behaviour extremely seriously.
Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Laura Huckins immediately
For official concerns, please see the MSSM ombuds office, or the title IX coordinator.

Our work will occasionally include discussion of topics which may be triggering or upsetting, for example eating disorders, sexual assualt, and childhood trauma. These discussions are appropriate to our research area, and do not constitute harassment. If these topics make you uncomfortable, please discuss this with Dr. Huckins.
