1. Vacations 
Please let me know if you are going on vacation at least two weeks in advance, by email. I'm defining vacation here as >2 consecutive days. If you're booking flights somewhere, please check the dates with me before you book. 

2. Long weekends/single days off.
If you'd like to take a single day off, or plan a long weekend, please let me know at least a week in advance. 

I do not expect you to do any work while you are on vacation, or to bring work laptops (etc) on vacation. 
As far as I am concerned, you do not need to be in email contact while you are away. 
There are two caveats to this:
While you are on vacation or long weekend, please set an 'out of office' reply to your email, so that collaborators know when to expect a reply.
There may be rare exceptions to this- eg if we are in the final stages of submitting a paper or grant. We can discuss those as/when they come up.
